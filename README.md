Electro-Thermal Modeling of Shading Effects and Bypass Diode Optimization in Photovoltaic Modules using COMSOL Multiphysics.
Developed a coupled electro-thermal COMSOL model of photovoltaic modules to study partial shading, hotspot formation, and bypass diode performance.
Conducted comparative studies of different shading geometries and demonstrated how bypass diodes significantly reduce hotspot severity and improve module output power.
Delivered clear temperature maps, I-V characteristics, and performance metrics, showcasing design strategies to mitigate shading losses in solar panels.
